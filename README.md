### Twitter and X

The rebranding of Twitter to "X" on July 24th, 2023, marked a significant shift in the platform's identity. This change may have led to confusion or dissatisfaction among the existing user base, contributing to a significant loss of 32 million users. This is the first time since 2008 that a decrease was anticipated. Twitter recently reported having 528.3 million monetizable monthly active users and 237.8 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU). Elon Musk, who rebranded Twitter to "X", is the most followed individual on the platform.

### Monetization

Back in 2022, Twitter was experimenting with various features aimed at improving user interaction and content sharing. Notable features included Twitter Communities, which allowed users to create and join groups around specific topics, and Twitter Blue, a premium subscription service offering exclusive features like bookmarks, custom app icons, new themes, and an undo button. 

From 2022 to 2024 Twitter/X transitioned towards a more integrated and monetization-focused approach, emphasizing partnerships, content creator incentives, and broader engagement strategies. Access to X Pro (formerly known as TweetDeck) is included with the Twitter Blue subscription, which starts at $8/month, or $84/year. The "Premium+" subscription is listed at $16 USD per month or $168 USD per year, and the "Basic" subscription is priced at $3 USD per month or $32 USD per year​​​​.

### TweetDeck

The transition of TweetDeck to a paid service under Twitter's (now X) subscription models like Twitter Blue or X Pro represents a significant shift from its previous free accessibility, potentially narrowing its user base to those willing to invest in advanced social media management features. This move could enhance the user experience for subscribers through continuous improvements and more sophisticated features, while also encouraging the development of alternative tools for users seeking free solutions. 

### Free Access

Twitter's free access model ensures a broad user base, fostering diverse content and perspectives. It supports social movements and activism by providing a free platform for public discourse. Businesses and marketers benefit from the wide reach for advertising and engagement, contributing significantly to Twitter's revenue.

Requiring all users to pay would likely reduce the user base as not everyone may be willing or able to afford the subscription. This could lead to a less diverse platform, potentially diminishing its role in social movements and public discussions. 

### Competition

Facebook remains significantly more popular in terms of user base. Facebook boasts 3.049 billion monthly active users (MAUs) and 2.085 billion daily active users (DAUs), reflecting its extensive global reach and engagement levels. This vast user base represents 37.75% of the world's total population and 57.53% of the world's active internet users accessing Facebook every month.
